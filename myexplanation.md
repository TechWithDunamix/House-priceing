# üè° House Price Prediction: A Step-by-Step Guide by Tech with Dunamix

Hello, students! Welcome to another exciting lesson at **Tech with Dunamix**. Today, we're going to learn how to predict house prices using some real data. This is going to be a hands-on project, so let‚Äôs dive right in! üöÄ

## Step 1: Getting Our Tools Ready

Before we start, we need to gather our tools‚Äîjust like preparing our workspace before starting any project. In coding, these tools are libraries. Let‚Äôs load them up:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

%matplotlib inline
```

**Why are we doing this?** Each of these libraries has a special purpose. For example, `pandas` helps us handle data, while `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are great for making graphs.

## Step 2: Opening the Data Treasure Chest

Now that our tools are ready, it‚Äôs time to open up our dataset. Imagine it‚Äôs like opening a treasure chest filled with information!

```python
file_name = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/kc_house_data_NaN.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_name)
```

**What‚Äôs happening here?** We‚Äôre pulling the data from an online source and loading it into a DataFrame (`df`). Think of a DataFrame as a big table where we can see all our data at once.

## Step 3: Taking a Quick Peek at Our Data

Before diving deep, it‚Äôs good to take a quick look at our data. This helps us understand what we‚Äôre dealing with:

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

**Why is this important?** Knowing the type of data in each column will guide us in how to clean and analyze it.

## Step 4: Cleaning Up the Data

Imagine you‚Äôre an archaeologist dusting off a newly discovered artifact. We need to do something similar by cleaning our data. Let‚Äôs get rid of some unnecessary columns:

```python
df.drop(['id', 'Unnamed: 0'], axis=1, inplace=True)
print(df.describe())
```

**Why clean up?** The columns `id` and `Unnamed: 0` don‚Äôt add any value to our analysis, so we‚Äôre removing them to keep things tidy.

## Step 5: Fixing Missing Values

Sometimes our data has missing pieces, just like a puzzle with a few missing parts. Let‚Äôs fix that by filling in those gaps:

```python
# Checking for missing values
print("Number of NaN values for the column bedrooms:", df['bedrooms'].isnull().sum())
print("Number of NaN values for the column bathrooms:", df['bathrooms'].isnull().sum())

# Replacing NaN with the average value
mean_bedrooms = df['bedrooms'].mean()
df['bedrooms'].replace(np.nan, mean_bedrooms, inplace=True)

mean_bathrooms = df['bathrooms'].mean()
df['bathrooms'].replace(np.nan, mean_bathrooms, inplace=True)

# Checking again
print("Number of NaN values for the column bedrooms:", df['bedrooms'].isnull().sum())
print("Number of NaN values for the column bathrooms:", df['bathrooms'].isnull().sum())
```

**Why fill in the gaps?** Missing values can disrupt our analysis, so we replace them with the average to keep our data complete.

## Step 6: Exploring the Data

Now that our data is clean, let‚Äôs get to know it better. We‚Äôll explore some key features to understand the patterns.

### 6.1 Counting Floors

First, let‚Äôs find out how many houses have each number of floors. This gives us a sense of the different types of houses in our dataset:

```python
floors_df = df['floors'].value_counts().to_frame()
print(floors_df)
```

**Why check this?** It‚Äôs helpful to know how common certain features are‚Äîlike the number of floors‚Äîbecause this might affect house prices.

### 6.2 Looking for Price Outliers

Next, let‚Äôs see if there are any houses with unusual prices based on whether they have a waterfront view:

```python
sns.boxplot(x='waterfront', y='price', data=df)
plt.show()
```

**Why use a boxplot?** Boxplots help us spot outliers‚Äîprices that are much higher or lower than usual. This is important because outliers can distort our analysis.

### 6.3 Correlation Between Size and Price

Do bigger houses cost more? Let‚Äôs find out by checking the relationship between the size of the house (`sqft_above`) and its price:

```python
sns.regplot(x='sqft_above', y='price', data=df)
plt.show()
```

**Why look at this?** Understanding this relationship helps us see if the size of a house is a good predictor of its price.

## Step 7: Building Our Prediction Model

Alright, it‚Äôs time to build our first model! This is where the magic happens‚Äîwe‚Äôre going to teach the computer to predict house prices.

### 7.1 Predicting with Longitude

First, let‚Äôs see if the longitude (`long`) of a house can predict its price:

```python
X = df[['long']]
Y = df['price']
lm = LinearRegression()
lm.fit(X, Y)
print("R^2 for `long` feature:", lm.score(X, Y))
```

**Why start here?** We‚Äôre testing a very basic model to see if location alone can predict price.

### 7.2 Predicting with Square Footage

Next, let‚Äôs try using the square footage (`sqft_living`) of the house to predict its price:

```python
X = df[['sqft_living']]
Y = df['price']
lm.fit(X, Y)
print("R^2 for `sqft_living` feature:", lm.score(X, Y))
```

**Why use square footage?** We expect the size of the house to be a strong predictor of its price‚Äîlet‚Äôs see if that‚Äôs true!

### 7.3 Using Multiple Features

Now, let‚Äôs get serious and use several features together to predict the price:

```python
features = ["floors", "waterfront", "lat", "bedrooms", "sqft_basement", "view", "bathrooms", "sqft_living15", "sqft_above", "grade", "sqft_living"]
X = df[features]
lm.fit(X, Y)
print("R^2 for multiple features:", lm.score(X, Y))
```

**Why combine features?** By using more information (like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.), we hope to improve our model‚Äôs accuracy.

### 7.4 Getting Fancy with Polynomial Features

Let‚Äôs add a twist! By using polynomial features, we can model more complex relationships between the features and price:

```python
Input = [('scale', StandardScaler()), ('polynomial', PolynomialFeatures(include_bias=False)), ('model', LinearRegression())]
pipe = Pipeline(Input)
pipe.fit(X, Y)
print("R^2 for polynomial features:", pipe.score(X, Y))
```

**Why polynomial features?** Sometimes the relationship between features and price isn‚Äôt simple‚Äîa polynomial can capture those complexities better.

## Step 8: Fine-Tuning the Model

### 8.1 Splitting the Data

To really test our model, we should split the data into a training set and a test set. This way, we can see how well our model does on new, unseen data:

```python
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.15, random_state=1)
print("Number of test samples:", X_test.shape[0])
print("Number of training samples:", X_train.shape[0])
```

**Why split the data?** It‚Äôs like studying for an exam‚Äîwe want to see how well we‚Äôve learned by testing ourselves on different problems.

### 8.2 Trying Ridge Regression

Let‚Äôs try another method‚ÄîRidge Regression. This helps prevent our model from getting too complex and overfitting:

```python
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=0.1)
ridge_model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
print("R^2 for Ridge regression:", ridge_model.score(X_test, Y_test))
```

**Why Ridge Regression?** It adds a penalty for large coefficients, which helps keep our model balanced and generalizes better to new data.

### 8.3 Ridge Regression with Polynomial Features

Finally, let‚Äôs combine Ridge Regression with polynomial features for an even more powerful model:

```python
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)
X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)

ridge_model_poly = Ridge(alpha=0.1)
ridge_model_poly.fit(X_train_poly, Y_train)
print("R^2 for polynomial Ridge regression:", ridge_model_poly.score(X_test_poly, Y_test))
```

**Why this combo?** This gives us a sophisticated model that can handle complex data while avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting.
